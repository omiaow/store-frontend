# Shopping Mobile Application

This project is a shopping platform designed for both providers (store owners) and customers.
It allows providers to manage stores and products, while customers can browse and book items easily.

### Provider Side

The Provider Side is implemented as a Telegram Mini App, styled and optimized to look and feel like a mobile application.

Providers can perform the following actions:

- Create and manage their own store
- Create multiple branches for a store
- Add new products to the store
- Replenish and manage product stock
- Accept and process orders from customers
- Manually create orders if needed

### Customer Side

The Customer Side allows users to interact with stores and products.

Customers can:

- View a list of products from a specific store
- Select products and specify quantities
- Submit a request to book the selected products

## Summary

- Providers manage stores, branches, inventory, and orders via a Telegram Mini App
- Customers browse products and book items from stores
- The application is designed to be simple, mobile-friendly, and efficient for both sides
